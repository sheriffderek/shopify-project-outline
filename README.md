By {{company-name}} (Los Angeles)

* Staging store: [https://tcsjerky.myshopify.com](https://tcsjerky.myshopify.com)

* Live store: [{{store-name}}.myshopify.com]({{store-name}}.myshopify.com)

Preview password: `....`


## Setup

`{{tcsjerky}}` is a good enough prefix/key for any naming conventions

Standard Shopify theme style / (no alternate build systems - slate etc)

Starting with this `{{theme-name}}` theme _(IF starting from a 3rd party theme)_

An 'app' is setup for themekit authentication already (called _ThemeKit_)

`theme get --list -p={{password}} -s={{store}}.myshopify.com` to get the list of themes

Clone this repo in a folder called _sites/shopify/`{{tcsjerky}}`_ or whatever you do

Move into that folder before pulling down the theme files from the live instance

`theme get -p={{password}} -s={{store-name}}.myshopify.com -t={{theme-id}}`

This will show any updates that may have happend on the live site / and you can commit them.
